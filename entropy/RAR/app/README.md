# Pyth Entropy Example

This Next.js project demonstrates a basic use case of Pyth Entropy by integrating it into a web application to simulate the growth process of NFTs. The application features frontend components and hooks to interact with smart contracts, handle state changes, and respond to events.

## Features

- **Minting NFTs**: Users can mint new NFTs.
- **Growing NFTs**: Users can request to grow their NFTs based on randomness provided by the Pyth network.
- **Event Watching**: The application listens to contract events to update UI accordingly.

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js installed on your machine.
- Bun installed for fast package management.
- Farmiliarity with Next.js, Wagmi.sh, Tailwind, Shad.cn and React Query

### Installation

Clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
bun i
```

### Running the Development Server

To start the development server, run:

```bash
bun dev
```

This will start the server on `http://localhost:3000`, and you can view your application in the browser.
